COVID-19 Country-Wise Data Analysis

This project analyzes the country_wise_latest COVID-19 dataset using R as part of the Data Science and Toolkit course.
The main objective is to explore global COVID-19 patterns through visualisation and derive meaningful insights from the data.

The analysis includes:

Identifying the top 10 countries with the highest confirmed cases

Identifying the top 10 countries with the highest deaths

Understanding global share of cases and deaths using pie charts

Exploring distribution of confirmed cases using a histogram

Generating findings that highlight uneven global impact

The project uses tidyverse, ggplot2, and base R plotting tools.

🎯 Project Objectives

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on COVID-19 global data

Generate meaningful visualisations

Interpret visual patterns and summarise insights

Strengthen understanding of R programming and data visualisation

📊 Visualisations Included

Bar Chart: Top 10 countries by confirmed cases

Bar Chart: Top 10 countries by deaths

Pie Chart: Percentage share of confirmed cases (Top 10)

Pie Chart: Percentage share of deaths (Top 10)

Histogram: Distribution of confirmed cases

These graphs help identify trends, outliers, and regions disproportionately affected by the pandemic.

📁 Dataset

Name: country_wise_latest.csv

Source: Provided as part of the course

Rows: 187 countries

Columns: Includes confirmed cases, deaths, recovered cases, WHO region, etc.

🛠️ Technologies Used

R Programming Language

tidyverse (data cleaning & manipulation)

ggplot2 (visualisation)

Base R plotting (pie charts)

📌 Key Insights

COVID-19 impact is highly uneven across countries.

A small group of countries account for most global cases and deaths.

The distribution of confirmed cases is right-skewed, showing few extreme outliers.

Visualisation clearly highlights disparities in spread and mortality.
