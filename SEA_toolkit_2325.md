## Findings from Visualisation

##  Introduction

This analysis explores the *country_wise_latest* COVID-19 dataset using various data visualisations.  
The goal is to understand the global distribution of confirmed cases and deaths through graphical interpretation.

The visualisations created include:
- Bar chart of top 10 confirmed cases  
- Bar chart of top 10 deaths  
- Pie charts for confirmed and deaths  
- Histogram of confirmed cases

## 📊 1. Top 10 Countries by Confirmed Cases

The bar chart shows that the majority of confirmed COVID-19 cases are concentrated in a small number of countries.

### **Findings**
- A few countries (e.g., USA, India, Brazil) dominate the global case count.  
- The distribution is **highly right-skewed**, meaning only a handful of countries have extremely high numbers.  
- There is a significant gap between the highest and lower-ranked countries.

## ⚰️ 2. Top 10 Countries by Deaths

The bar chart for deaths shows similar dominance by countries with the highest confirmed infections.

### **Findings**
- Countries with high confirmed cases also report high deaths.  
- Some countries show disproportionately higher deaths relative to cases.  
- Mortality impact is **not uniform**, reflecting differences in healthcare quality, detection, and response.  

---

## 🥧 3. Pie Chart – Share of Confirmed Cases

The pie chart displays the percentage contribution of the top 10 countries to total global confirmed cases.

### **Findings**
- The top 10 countries account for a **large share** of total global cases.  
- Case distribution is heavily concentrated in a few regions.  
- Remaining countries contribute much less comparatively.  

---

## 🥧 4. Pie Chart – Share of Deaths

The pie chart for deaths also shows uneven distribution.

### **Findings**
- A few countries dominate the global share of total deaths.  
- Higher shares suggest greater exposure, population size, or weaker healthcare systems.  

---

## 📈 5. Histogram – Distribution of Confirmed Cases

The histogram reveals how confirmed cases are spread across all countries.

### **Findings**
- The distribution is **right-skewed**, meaning most countries have lower case counts.  
- Only a few countries act as extreme outliers with very high confirmed numbers.  
- This indicates significant variation in outbreak severity across countries.  

---

## 🟣 Overall Conclusion

- The impact of COVID-19 is **uneven and concentrated** in a few countries.  
- Case and death distributions show major disparities worldwide.  
- Pie charts reinforce that top countries dominate global totals.  
- Histogram highlights outliers and unequal pandemic spread.  
- The visualisations collectively reveal patterns in infection spread, severity, and mortality differences across countries.
